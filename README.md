# Voyager

Voyager is a travel planner that lets users create and edit itineraries. Users can search for locations using an interactive map and add them to their itinerary. Each location they add has a dedicated page where users can view the location on a map and add location-specific points of interest. They can either search for a specific place to go, or they can use the 'Explore' button to find recommended places near that location. Each itinerary, location, and point of interest the user creates is fully editable. Voyager uses the [Mapbox JavaScript API](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/) to provide the user with interactive maps and the [Foursquare Places API](https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/places-api/) to provide them with points of interest data.
